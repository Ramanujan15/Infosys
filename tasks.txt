Tasks
Given a string, write program to print only alphabets in the given string
s = input("Enter a string: ")
result = ""
for ch in s:
    if ch.isalpha():   # check if character is an alphabet
        result += ch
print("Alphabets in the string:", result)

Given string write program that prints all the uppercase letters of the string
s = input("Enter a string: ")
result = ""
for ch in s:
    if ch.isupper():   # check if character is uppercase
        result += ch
print("Uppercase letters in the string:", result)

See about built in functions and what is the use case of built-in functions its advantages and where do we use it

Built-in functions are the functions that come pre-defined in a programming language.
They are ready to use and provided by the language itself (not written by the user).
Examples:
 → print(), len(), type(), max(), min(), sum(), input()

Try to do a simple calculator using python
a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))
op = input("Choose operation (+, -, *, /): ")

if op == "+":
    print("Result =", a + b)
elif op == "-":
    print("Result =", a - b)
elif op == "*":
    print("Result =", a * b)
elif op == "/":
    print("Result =", a / b if b != 0 else " Not allowed")
else:
    print("Invalid operation")

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
for:
Repeats a block of code for each item in a sequence or range
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

        print(num, end=" ")
        num += 1
    print()
 
Write a program that reads a number N and prints two Right Angled Triangles of N rows, using numbers starting from 1.

    for j in range(i):
        print(num, end=" ")
        num += 1
    print()
print()  
num = 1
for i in range(N, 0, -1):
    for j in range(i):
        print(num, end=" ")
        num += 1
    print()
 
Write a program to print the factorial of N Factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N.
N = int(input("Enter N: "))
fact = 1
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    fact *= i
print("Factorial of", N, "is:", fact)

Write a program that reads a string and prints the count of vowels in the string.
text = input("Enter a string: ")
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
count = 0
for ch in text:
    if ch in vowels:
        count += 1
print("Number of vowels:", count)

Given two numbers X and N, write a program to print the sum of N terms in the given series.
Series:
(x)^2, (xx)^2, (xxx)², N terms
X = int(input("Enter X: "))
N = int(input("Enter N: "))
total = 0
for i in range(2, N + 2):   # starting from "xx" (2 digits) till N terms
    term = int(str(X) * i)  # make number like 22, 222, etc.
    total += term ** 2
print("Sum of series =", total)

2 Table using python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"2 x {i} = {2*i}")

write a program to print sum of 1 st five natural nums 
s = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    s += i
print("Sum =", s)

create a variable meghna  condition if meghna died it should print( surya meets priya) if meghna not died it should print(meghna weds surya)

meghna = "alive"
print("surya meets priya" if meghna == "died" else "meghna weds surya")

Python code to find odd or even
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd")

Perimeter of rectangle
l = float(input("Enter length: "))
w = float(input("Enter width: "))
print("Perimeter =", 2 * (l + w))

Program
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language to make a computer perform a specific task.

Why do we need python
It is simple, versatile, and powerful for web development, data science, AI, automation.

Application of python
•	Web Development 
•	Data Science 
•	Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning 
•	Automation
•	Game Development 
•	Desktop Applications 
•	Cybersecurity 
•	IoT
Variable
A variable is a named storage location in memory used to hold data that can change during program execution. variable is stored at a specific address.

What is value
value is the actual data stored in a variable, such as a number, Boolean.

What is data type
Data type defines the kind of value a variable can hold.

Declaration and initialisation
Declaration is creating a variable by specifying its name (and type in some languages), while initialization is assigning an initial value to that variable.

Pandas and numpy 
NumPy is used for fast numerical operations on arrays,
Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis with labeled data.

Difference between library and frame work
A library is code you call to do tasks, while a framework calls your code and controls the program’s flow.
Swapping
Exchanging the values of two variables
a, b = 5, 10
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)   

Counting
Finding the number of occurrences of an element using .count().
Searching
Finding the position of an element using .find()
Title
First character of every word to uppercase
Replace
Returns a new string where all occurrences of a substring are replaced with another substring.
Strip
Removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.
Break
Used to exit a loop immediately when a condition is met.
Pass
A null statement used as a placeholder that does nothing.
Islower
Returns True if all characters in the string are lowercase.
Isalpha
Returns True if all characters in the string are alphabets.
If
The if statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
If-else
The if-else statement executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes the other block.
Nested if
A nested if means using an if statement inside another if to check multiple conditions.
isalnum 
Returns True if all characters in the string are alphabets or digits
Odd or even
num = int(input())
print("Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd") 

For Initializing -> git init
2. for adding -> git add .
3. for checking status -> git status
4. for commiting -> git commit -m "Initial commit"
5. for push -> git push -u origin main
git log
git if
git pull
staging and unstaging
commit #
grt reset
getbranch
git stach
Add 2 integers
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(“Add”,a+b)
Perimeter of rectangle
I=int(input())
w= int(input())
print(2*(i+w))

txt=”Hello,I am ram”
x=txt.startswith(“Hello”)
print(x)
Factorial
n= int(input())
fact=1
i=1
while i<=n:
fact=fact*i
i+=1
print(fact)

Instruction
Module: Data Preprocessing & ED
Download and preprocess air quality datasets.
Conduct EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand pollutant trends and correlations.
Resample data and prepare features for forecasting.
